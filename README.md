KnowMe App
A small web app that helps you memorize people’s names using simple profile cards and groups.

People often forget names at events, classes, or work, so this tool makes name learning quick and fun.

Install dependencies, start the dev server, and open the local URL, or run it directly in Google AI Studio using its preview or deploy button.

The app currently supports user login, groups, profile cards, marking names as known, and a basic SuperAdmin panel to manage users and roles.

With more time, it would include better analytics, name pronunciation, spaced-repetition training, smoother UI, and import options for event organizers.
